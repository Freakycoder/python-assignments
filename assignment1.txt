## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Ans)  Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language . Object-oriented means this language is based around objects (such as data) rather than functions, and high-level means it's easy for humans to understand.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

ANS)  Dynamic typing means that the type of the variable is determined only during runtime.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

ANS) pros - (i) large community , extensive libraries
     cons - (i) slower than compiled languages , high memory comsumption

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

ANS) some of the domains are ;
      (i) data science  (ii) web development (iii) AI

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

ANS)  Variables are the basic unit of storage in a programming language. variables consist of a data type, the variable name, and the value to be assigned to the variable.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

ANS) By creating a variable and then using the input() built in function.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

ANS)  A string

Q8. What is type casting?

ANS) Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

ANS) Yes, we can take by using split() method ;

     # taking two inputs at a time  
     a, b, c = input("Enter three values: ").split()  
     print("Enter Your First Name: ", a)  
     print("Enter Your Last Name: ", b)  
     print("Enter Your Class: ", c) 

Q10. What are keywords?

ANS) Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

ANS) We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name or any other identifier. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language. In Python, keywords are case sensitive.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentation in Python?

ANS) Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

ANS) By using the print() method.

Q14. What are operators in Python?

ANS) operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

ANS) the first one is '/' float division whether as the second is floor division '//' .
     the float division returns the ans in float data type and floor division return the quotient when 2 numbers are divided.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
ANS) a= "iNeuron"
     print(a*4)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

ANS) a = int(input("enter any number of your wish : "))
     if(a % 2 == 0):
         print("the number is even")
     else:
         print("the number is odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?

ANS) True , False , not , and , and or are the only built-in Python Boolean operators.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```
ANS) (i) 1   (ii) 0  (iii) false  (iv) 1
     
Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

ANS) It is used to handle conditions in your program.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

ANS) The if / elif / else structure is a common way to control the flow of a program.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

ANS) a = int(input("enter any number of your wish : "))
     if(a >= 18):
         print("yes you can vote")
     else:
         print("No you cannot vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
ANS) number = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
     sum = 0
     for i in number:
         if(i % 2 == 0 ):
             sum = sum + i
         else:
             continue
     print("the sum of even nos in the list is :" ,sum)


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

ANS) 

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
ANS) numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for i in numbers:
    if(i % 5 == 0):
        continue
    else:
        numbers.remove(i)
    if(i > 150 ):
        continue
    elif(i>500):
        break
print(numbers)
